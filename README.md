# Length Conversion App
## Mini Project 03

![standard picture of app](standard.png)

This app takes in an input and a chosen unit, and outputs the value of that unit converted to the specified output unit. While building this app, I gained experience using @Binding and @State to handle user input.

The app also used @FocusState to toggle the keyboard's visibility.
