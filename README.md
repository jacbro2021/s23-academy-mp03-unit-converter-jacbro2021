# Length Conversion App
## Mini Project 03

<div align = "center">
  <img src = "home.png" alt = "image of app home screen"/>
</div>

This is a unit conversion app that supports conversions for Volume, Temperature, Time, and Length. 

<div align = "center">
  <img src = "standard.png" alt = "standard image of app"/>
</div>

This app takes in an input and a chosen unit, and outputs the value of that unit converted to the specified output unit. While building this app, I gained experience using the Swiftui Navigation view, @Binding, and @State to handle user input. 

<div align = "center">
  <img src = "keyboard.png" alt = "image with keyboard displayed"/>
</div>

The app also used @FocusState to toggle the keyboard's visibility.
